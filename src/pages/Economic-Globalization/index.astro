		<section>
			<div>
				So taking internal jobs and giving them to external places to do them. Yeah this sounds good...
                Most knowledge tasks such as desinging or engineering would take place in countries with high educations
                <ul>
                    <li>Finland ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡®</li>
                    <li>Sweden ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª</li>
                    <li>Japan ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ</li>
                    <li>Korea ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡·</li>
                    <li>Me lol ðŸ˜€</li>
                    <li>Heimler ðŸ§”</li>
                </ul>
                Along with manufacturing jobs being sent to countires where labor is cheaper and industrialized like:
                <ul>
                    <li>Mexico ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½</li>
                    <li>Coasta Rica ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡·</li>
                    <li>Real China ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¼</li>

        <h1>Free trade</h1>
		<section>
			<div>
				As globalization spread so did the economic effects.
                This of course lead to a connected global econonomy in which every country relies on each other for resources and goods.
                Now all of this trading was called free trade as governments and companies could trade with eachother freely without much restriction

                <h2>Organizations & Policies</h2>
                There had to be some order at the very least to get this to work
                Few examples are the:
                <ul>
                    <li>NAFTA, A free trade agreement between mexico, canada, and the USA.</li>
                    <li>WTO (World Trade Organization), An Organization created by the UN to monitor and facilitate free trade agreements across the globe.</li>

                </ul>
