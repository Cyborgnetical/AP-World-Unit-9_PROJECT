		<h1>The spread of culture</h1>

				There is no denying that global culture is within our own daily lives. I mean here in california alone we eat food from mexico while we are in the USA.<br> We listen to music that has originated here like rock, but has completely devloped in a different country like Sabaton. Or we brought our own music from mexico like <a href="https://youtu.be/QPelGxI2vi8?si=RleDBucIIpa3exjf&t=12">Banda MS</a>

		<h1 style="text-align: right;">Cultural Diffusion</h1>
		<section>
			<div>
				So culture spreads around the world and becomes part of other cultures. We can thank this due to the spread of <a href="/AP-World-Unit-9_PROJECT/Tech-&-Innvation">technology</a> allowing us to communicate fast and around the globe.
				Even companies such as KFC have made it outside the USA into reigons like china (Yes the communist one)

				As in the <a href="/AP-World-Unit-9_PROJECT">intro of this website</a> I meantioned music as an example of cultural Diffusion. Somehow European bands making their way into the USA.
				<h2>Global show of Nationalism: Soccer</h2>
				You know the world cup that airs every 4 years. Most of out there watching are supporting a spesific country, most likely our birthplace or ethnic homeland.

				<br>Even I am guilty of this, cheering on Mexico during the wrold cup when it was obvious we were gonna loose. (I am sorry if some of the content of the video is offesnive to some.)
